# Webhook Testing with ngrok - Step by Step Guide

## Current Setup Status
âœ… Next.js dev server running on `localhost:3000`
âœ… ngrok tunnel active (check ngrok web interface at http://127.0.0.1:4040)
âœ… Webhook endpoint ready at `/api/webhooks/clerk`
âœ… Test endpoint available at `/api/webhooks/test`

## Step 1: Get Your ngrok URL

1. Open the ngrok web interface: http://127.0.0.1:4040
2. Copy the **https** URL (it will look like: `https://abc123.ngrok.io`)
3. Your webhook URL will be: `https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok.io/api/webhooks/clerk`

## Step 2: Test Basic Connectivity

Before setting up Clerk, let's test if the webhook is accessible:

### Test the basic endpoint:
```bash
# Replace YOUR_NGROK_URL with your actual ngrok URL
curl https://YOUR_NGROK_URL.ngrok.io/api/webhooks/test
```

You should see a response like:
```json
{
  "message": "Webhook endpoint is accessible",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-31T...",
  "status": "ready"
}
```

### Test POST to the test endpoint:
```bash
curl -X POST https://YOUR_NGROK_URL.ngrok.io/api/webhooks/test \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"test": "data"}'
```

## Step 3: Set Up Clerk Webhook

1. **Go to Clerk Dashboard**: https://dashboard.clerk.com
2. **Navigate to Webhooks**:
   - Click on your application
   - Go to "Webhooks" in the sidebar
   - Click "Add Endpoint"

3. **Configure the Webhook**:
   - **Endpoint URL**: `https://YOUR_NGROK_URL.ngrok.io/api/webhooks/clerk`
   - **Events**: Select these events:
     - âœ… `user.created`
     - âœ… `user.updated` 
     - âœ… `user.deleted`

4. **Get the Webhook Secret**:
   - After creating the endpoint, copy the signing secret
   - It will start with `whsec_...`

## Step 4: Update Environment Variable

Update your `.env` file with the real webhook secret:

```env
CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_your_actual_secret_from_clerk_dashboard
```

## Step 5: Test User Creation

1. **Create a test user** in your application:
   - Go to your sign-up page
   - Create a new account

2. **Check the webhook logs**:
   - In your terminal running the dev server, you should see logs
   - In Clerk dashboard â†’ Webhooks â†’ Your endpoint, check delivery logs

3. **Verify database**:
   - Check if the user was created in your database
   - You can use Prisma Studio: `npx prisma studio`

## Step 6: Monitor Webhook Activity

### In your terminal:
Watch for console logs showing webhook activity:
```
User created in database: user@example.com
```

### In Clerk Dashboard:
- Go to Webhooks â†’ Your endpoint
- Check the "Attempts" tab to see delivery status
- Green checkmarks = successful deliveries
- Red X = failed deliveries (click to see error details)

### In ngrok web interface:
- Visit http://127.0.0.1:4040
- Go to "Inspect" tab to see all HTTP requests
- Look for POST requests to `/api/webhooks/clerk`

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"Error occurred -- no svix headers"**
   - Make sure you're using the correct webhook URL
   - Verify the webhook is set up in Clerk dashboard

2. **"Error verifying webhook"**
   - Check that CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET is set correctly
   - Restart your dev server after updating .env

3. **Webhook not receiving events**
   - Verify ngrok tunnel is active
   - Check that the webhook URL in Clerk uses https://
   - Ensure selected events include user.created

4. **Database errors**
   - Check DATABASE_URL in .env
   - Verify Prisma schema is up to date: `npx prisma generate`

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] ngrok tunnel is running and accessible
- [ ] Test endpoint responds correctly
- [ ] Clerk webhook is configured with correct URL
- [ ] Environment variable is set with webhook secret
- [ ] Dev server restarted after env changes
- [ ] Test user signup creates database record
- [ ] Webhook logs appear in terminal
- [ ] Clerk dashboard shows successful deliveries

## Next Steps After Testing

Once everything works with ngrok:

1. Deploy your application to production (Vercel, Netlify, etc.)
2. Update the webhook URL in Clerk to your production URL
3. Set the CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET in your production environment
4. Test with production deployment

Your webhook should now automatically sync users between Clerk and your database! ðŸŽ‰
